# Skill Dependency Map

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Total Skills**: 24
**Circular References**: ✅ RESOLVED (was 4, now 0)

## Skill Organization

### Hierarchical Structure

Skills follow a parent-child hierarchical model with no circular references between siblings:

```
Parent Skill (Hub)
    ↓ (one-way reference)
Child Skills (Categories)
    ↓ (one-way references)
Implementation Skills (Concrete)
```

### Dynamic Lessons Structure

In addition to the static security skills, the system maintains a **dynamic lessons library** at `.agents/skills/lessons/`:

```
.agents/skills/lessons/
├── [topic-name-1]/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── [topic-name-2]/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── [topic-name-n]/
    └── SKILL.md
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- **User-Generated**: Created via `/retrospective` command after completing work
- **Session-Based**: Each lesson captures learnings from a specific session or task
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Amp should scan this folder before starting new work
- **Rich Context**: Contains what worked, what failed, exact parameters, and lessons learned

**Usage Pattern**:
1. **Before Work**: `/advise` command searches lessons for relevant past experience
2. **During Work**: Apply learnings from similar past tasks
3. **After Work**: `/retrospective` command creates new lesson for future reference

**Discovery Mechanism**:
- Lessons are discovered by scanning `.agents/skills/lessons/*/SKILL.md` files
- Each SKILL.md has a verbose `description` field with trigger phrases
- Amp matches user goals against description fields to find relevant lessons
- No static references needed - fully dynamic discovery

## Security Prompts Skills Hierarchy

### Parent (Hub)

**security-prompts** - Main directory and navigation hub
- Location: `.agents/skills/security/security-prompts/SKILL.md`
- Role: Provides overview, quick reference, directory of all template categories

  - `course-lesson-builder`
  - `security/*` (all implementation skills)
  - `security-awareness/*` (all awareness skills)

## Dependency Rules

### ✅ ALLOWED Dependencies

**Parent → Children** (one-way):
```
security-prompts → security-prompts-engineering
security-prompts → security-prompts-threat-modeling
security-prompts → security-prompts-auth
security-prompts → security-prompts-controls
```

**Children → Parent** (one-way back reference):
```
security-prompts-engineering → security-prompts
security-prompts-threat-modeling → security-prompts
security-prompts-auth → security-prompts
security-prompts-controls → security-prompts
```

**Children → Implementation Skills**:
```
security-prompts-engineering → csrf-protection
security-prompts-engineering → rate-limiting
security-prompts-engineering → security-testing
security-prompts-auth → auth-security
security-prompts-controls → csrf-protection
security-prompts-controls → rate-limiting
security-prompts-controls → input-validation
```

### ❌ FORBIDDEN Dependencies

**Siblings MUST NOT reference each other**:
```
❌ security-prompts-engineering ←→ security-prompts-auth
❌ security-prompts-engineering ←→ security-prompts-threat-modeling
❌ security-prompts-engineering ←→ security-prompts-controls
❌ security-prompts-auth ←→ security-prompts-threat-modeling
❌ security-prompts-auth ←→ security-prompts-controls
❌ security-prompts-threat-modeling ←→ security-prompts-controls
```

## Navigation Pattern

### For Users

When users need another template category:
1. Refer to parent skill (`security-prompts`)
2. Parent shows all available categories
3. User navigates to appropriate category

**Example**:
```
User in: security-prompts-engineering
Needs: Authentication templates
→ See parent security-prompts skill
→ Navigate to security-prompts-auth
```

### For Skills

Skills reference related skills using:

**Parent reference**:
```markdown
## Related Skills

**Parent Skill**:
- **security-prompts** - Main directory with all template categories
```

**Note to users**:
```markdown
**Note**: For other template categories (authentication, threat modeling, etc.),
see the parent `security-prompts` skill
```

---

## Implementation Skills

### Validation Rules

1. ✅ Children reference parent (allowed)
2. ✅ Parent references children (allowed)
3. ✅ Children reference implementation skills (allowed)
4. ❌ Siblings reference each other (FORBIDDEN)
5. ❌ Implementation skills reference category skills (FORBIDDEN)

## Best Practices

### When Creating New Skills

1. **Determine hierarchy**: Is this a parent, category, or implementation skill?
2. **Reference appropriately**:
   - Categories reference parent + implementation skills only
   - Never reference sibling categories
3. **Add navigation notes**: Guide users to parent for other categories
4. **Test**: Run verification script to check for circular references

### When Updating Skills

1. **Check references**: Ensure no new sibling references added
2. **Update parent**: If adding new category, update parent skill
3. **Maintain hierarchy**: Keep the parent-child structure intact
4. **Document changes**: Update version history

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks

**Monthly**: Run circular reference check
```bash
bash analyze-skill-references.sh
```

**Before Release**: Verify no circular references
**After Skill Addition**: Update this dependency map

### Tools

- `analyze-skill-references.sh` - Analyzes skill cross-references
- `skill-dependency-analysis.md` - Detailed analysis report (archived)
