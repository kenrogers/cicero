# 🔒 Secure Amp Skills

**Defense-in-depth security skills for Amp projects**

A collection of specialized security skills that implement enterprise-grade security controls for Next.js applications using Clerk authentication and Convex database. These skills help Amp generate secure, production-ready code that follows OWASP best practices.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This package is the core security engine of the [Secure Vibe Coding OS](https://github.com/harperaa/secure-vibe-coding-OS), but was separated into its own package for ease of use and distribution.  

Also, this package and the Secure Vibe Coding OS are part of the [Secure Vibe Coding Masterclass](https://allenharper.com) by [Dr. Allen Harper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drallenharper/). 

This package provides specialized Amp skills that teach Claude how to implement:

- **CSRF Protection** - Cross-Site Request Forgery prevention
- **Rate Limiting** - Brute force and abuse prevention
- **Input Validation** - XSS and injection attack prevention
- **Security Headers** - Browser-level security controls
- **Error Handling** - Information leakage prevention
- **Authentication Security** - Clerk integration best practices
- **Payment Security** - Clerk Billing and Stripe security
- **Dependency Security** - Supply chain protection
- **Security Testing** - Automated security verification

**Plus Security Awareness Skills:**

In addition to implementation skills, this package includes comprehensive **Security Awareness** skills that help Claude understand *why* AI-generated code is insecure:

- **Awareness Overview** - Statistics, research, and real-world breach examples
- **Injection Vulnerabilities** - SQL injection, command injection, XSS with real attack scenarios
- **Auth Vulnerabilities** - Broken authentication patterns and credential storage risks
- **Information Leakage** - Error message exposure and logging vulnerabilities
- **Supply Chain Risks** - Dependency confusion and malicious packages
- **Business Logic Flaws** - Race conditions and integer overflow examples
- **Resource Exhaustion** - DoS vulnerabilities and resource abuse

These awareness skills educate Claude about the **45% vulnerability rate in AI-generated code** (Veracode 2024), helping it understand security risks before implementing solutions.

Each skill provides Claude with deep knowledge of security patterns, common vulnerabilities, and secure implementation approaches specific to the Next.js + Clerk + Convex stack.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

According to Veracode's 2024 State of Software Security Report, **AI-generated code picks insecure patterns 45% of the time**. When developers use AI assistants like Amp without security guidance, they often generate code with:

- Missing CSRF protection
- No rate limiting
- Insufficient input validation
- Hardcoded credentials
- Information leakage through errors
- Weak authentication patterns

These skills solve this by providing Claude with expert security knowledge, resulting in **secure-by-default code generation**.

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Install security skills with one command:

```bash
npx secure-claude-skills init
```

This creates `.agents/skills/security/` in your project with all security skills.

### Installation Methods

#### Method 1: Copy Installation (No Sync)

Best for: One-time setup, you'll customize the skills for your needs

```bash
npx secure-claude-skills init
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple one-command install
- ✅ No git complexity
- ✅ Customize freely

**Cons:**
- ❌ No automatic updates
- ❌ To update, re-run command

---

#### Method 2: Subtree Installation (Stay Synced)

Best for: Get ongoing security improvements as skills are enhanced

```bash
# First-time installation
npx secure-claude-skills init --sync subtree

# Get updates later
npx secure-claude-skills update
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic sync with updates
- ✅ One-command updates
- ✅ Two-way sync (contribute back)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires git repository
- ❌ Slightly more complex

**Requirements:**
- Git repository initialized
- No uncommitted changes (commit first)

---

#### Method 3: Submodule Installation (Versioned Updates)

Best for: Control exactly which version you use

```bash
# First-time installation
npx secure-claude-skills init --sync submodule

# Update to latest
cd .agents/skills/security && git pull
cd ../../.. && git add .agents/skills/security
git commit -m "Update security skills"
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Version control
- ✅ Explicit updates
- ✅ Easy rollback

**Cons:**
- ❌ Manual update process
- ❌ Team needs submodule knowledge

**Requirements:**
- Git repository initialized

---

### Alternative: Install Directly from GitHub

Don't want to use npm? Install directly from GitHub:

#### Method A: Git Subtree (Stay Synced)

```bash
# Install skills with sync
git subtree add --prefix=.agents/skills/security \
  https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main --squash

# Update later
git subtree pull --prefix=.agents/skills/security \
  https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main --squash
```

#### Method B: Git Submodule (Versioned)

```bash
# Install as submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git \
  .agents/skills/security

# Update later
cd .agents/skills/security && git pull origin main
```

#### Method C: Simple Clone (No Sync)

```bash
# Clone directly
git clone https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git \
  .agents/skills/security

# Remove git history (optional)
rm -rf .agents/skills/security/.git
```

#### Method D: Download ZIP

1. Go to https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills
2. Click "Code" → "Download ZIP"
3. Extract to `.agents/skills/security/`

---

### Updating Skills

If you installed with sync enabled:

```bash
# For subtree installations
npx secure-claude-skills update

# For submodule installations
cd .agents/skills/security && git pull origin main
```

If you installed as copy:

```bash
# Re-run to get latest
npx secure-claude-skills init --force
```

## 🎓 How to Use

Once installed, use skills in your Amp conversations:

### Example: Implementing CSRF Protection

```
You: I need to add CSRF protection to my API routes

Amp: I'll help you implement CSRF protection using the
csrf-protection skill.

[Claude reads .agents/skills/security/csrf-protection/skill.md]
[Claude implements withCsrf middleware following the skill's guidance]
```

### Example: Adding Rate Limiting

```
You: Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse

Amp: I'll implement rate limiting using the rate-limiting skill.

[Claude reads .agents/skills/security/rate-limiting/skill.md]
[Claude implements withRateLimit middleware following OWASP guidelines]
```
