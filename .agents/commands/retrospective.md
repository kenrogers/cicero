# IMPORTANT: Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Use progressive disclosure to find relevant skills efficiently:**

1. Identify skills related to the technologies and patterns used in this session
2. Use progressive disclosure to match relevant skills without reading entire files
3. Present matched skill names to user
4. Ask which skills might need updating
5. Read ONLY the specific sections being updated (Failed Attempts, Parameters, Best Practices)
6. Never read full 400-line skill files

**Efficiency Target**: Read <200 total lines during retrospective

# Session Retrospective - Capture Your Learnings

Let me help you document what you learned during this session so you can reference it in future work.

## Step 0: Check Working Directory Status

**IMPORTANT**: Before creating a retrospective, ensure your working directory is clean.

### Check for Unstaged Changes

```bash
git status
```

**If there are unstaged or uncommitted changes:**

```
⚠️  WARNING: You have uncommitted changes in your working directory!

Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   src/some-file.ts
  modified:   lib/another-file.ts

Untracked files:
  new-feature.ts

🛑 STOP: Please commit or stash your changes before running retrospective.

Why? The retrospective will create a clean commit containing ONLY:
- Your new lesson documentation
- Updates to existing skills (if any)

Mixing this with other work makes the history unclear and harder to review.

Please do one of the following:

Option A: Commit your current work
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your work description"

Option B: Stash your changes temporarily
  git stash push -m "WIP: saving before retrospective"
  # After retrospective is done, restore with:
  # git stash pop

Then run /retrospective again.
```

**Exit retrospective - do not proceed.**

---

**If working directory is clean:**

```
✅ Working directory is clean. Proceeding with retrospective...
```

Continue to Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Choose Workflow

**ASK THE USER:** How would you like to save your learnings?

Present these options:

**Question**: "How would you like to save this lesson?"

**Options**:

1. **Direct to Main** (Recommended for solo developers)
   - Quick and simple
   - Commit directly to main branch
   - Lesson immediately available
   - No PR review needed

2. **Branch + Pull Request** (Recommended for teams)
   - Create feature branch
   - Push and create PR for review
   - Team can review before merging
   - Better for collaborative projects

**Based on their choice, proceed with the corresponding workflow in Step 5.**

## Step 2: Summarize Key Findings

**Analyzing this conversation to extract:**
- Primary goal and what you were trying to accomplish
- Approaches that worked successfully
- Failed attempts and what went wrong
- Final working solution with exact parameters
- Key insights and lessons learned

## Step 3: Create Skill Documentation

**Creating new skill in:** `.agents/skills/lessons/[topic-name]/`

The skill will include:

### SKILL.md Structure:

## Step 4: Analyze and Update Existing Skills (Progressive Disclosure)

### 4.1: Identify Related Skills

**Use skill discovery to find skills related to the session's technologies and patterns:**
- `.agents/skills/security/` - Security implementation patterns
- `.agents/skills/lessons/` - Past learnings
- `.agents/skills/` - All custom skills

**Important**: Match skills based on the user's session WITHOUT reading entire files.

### 4.2: Present Potential Updates

```
## 🔄 Skills That Could Benefit From Your Learnings

Based on your session, these existing skills might need updating:

1. **[skill-name-1]** - [Why this session's learnings apply]
2. **[skill-name-2]** - [How your findings improve this skill]
3. **[skill-name-3]** - [Connection to your work]

Would you like me to analyze these and propose updates?
```

### 4.3: Propose Specific Changes

For each skill the user wants to update, read ONLY the relevant sections:

```
## 📝 Proposed Updates to Existing Skills

### 1. csrf-protection/SKILL.md

**Proposed Changes:**

**Add to Failed Attempts Table:**
| Attempt | What We Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| New | Parse body before CSRF validation | CSRF token was consumed | Validate CSRF before body parsing |

**Update Best Practices Section:**
- Add: "Always validate CSRF tokens BEFORE parsing request body"

**Update Code Example:**
\`\`\`typescript
// Updated validation order based on session findings
\`\`\`

**Reasoning:** Your session revealed that parsing body before CSRF validation causes failures.

---

### 2. rate-limiting/SKILL.md

**Proposed Changes:**

**Update Exact Parameters Section:**
- Change: "5-10 requests per minute"
- To: "5 requests per minute (optimal based on production testing)"
- Add: "Testing showed 10 req/min allowed some abuse patterns"

**Add to Lessons Learned:**
- "Start with conservative limits (5 req/min) and increase based on monitoring, not the reverse"

**Reasoning:** Your testing found specific optimal values that improve the skill's guidance.

---

Total Skills to Update: 2
Total Changes: 5

Would you like to apply these updates? (yes/no)
```

### 4.4: Get User Permission

**Question:** "Should we update existing skills based on your learnings?"

**Options:**
1. **Yes, update all** - Apply all proposed changes
2. **Let me review** - Show me each change for individual approval
3. **No, just create the lesson** - Skip updating existing skills

### 4.5: Apply Updates (If Approved)

If user approves:

**For "Yes, update all":**
- Apply all proposed changes to existing skills
- Include updated skills in the git commit
- Commit message includes both new lesson AND skill updates

**For "Let me review":**
- Walk through each proposed change
- Ask yes/no for each one
- Apply approved changes
- Include in git commit

**For "No, just create the lesson":**
- Skip to Step 5 with only the new lesson

### 4.6: Update Commit Message

If skills were updated, enhance the commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add lesson: [topic-name] and update related skills

New Lesson:
- Created: .agents/skills/lessons/[topic-name]/SKILL.md
- Documented: [brief summary]

Updated Existing Skills:
- csrf-protection: Added failed attempt, updated best practices
- rate-limiting: Updated optimal parameters based on testing

Session learnings:
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- [Key point 3]

Success rate: [X/Y attempts]
Final solution: [Brief description]"
```

## Step 5: Save to Git Repository

### Workflow A: Direct to Main

```bash
# Add the new lesson and any updated existing skills
git add .agents/skills/lessons/[topic-name]/
git add .agents/skills/security/**/SKILL.md  # If security skills were updated
git add .agents/skills/**/SKILL.md          # If other skills were updated

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add lesson: [topic-name] and update related skills

💡 **Pro Tip:** The more specific and detailed your skill documentation, the more valuable it will be in future sessions. Include exact error messages, specific version numbers, and concrete examples.

## 🔄 Feedback Loop

This retrospective process creates a **compound learning system**:

1. **New Lesson Created** → Documents your specific experience
2. **Existing Skills Updated** → Improves general best practices with real-world findings
3. **Future Sessions** → Benefit from both the lesson AND improved skills
4. **Continuous Improvement** → Skills get more accurate and comprehensive over time

**Example Impact:**
- Session 1: Discover CSRF validation order matters → Create lesson + Update csrf-protection skill
- Session 2: Someone else uses csrf-protection skill → Avoids your mistake immediately
- Session 3: You use /advise before CSRF work → Find both the lesson AND updated skill
- Result: Team knowledge compounds, mistakes aren't repeated, development accelerates

**Key Principle:** Your learnings don't just help YOU later - they improve the shared knowledge base for everyone using this system.
