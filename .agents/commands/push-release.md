# Push Release - Automated Release Management

Automate the entire release process including versioning, changelog generation, git tagging, and GitHub release creation.

---

## Step 1: Check Working Directory Status

**CRITICAL**: Ensure working directory is clean before creating a release.

```bash
git status
```

**If there are uncommitted changes:**

```
⚠️  WARNING: You have uncommitted changes!

Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   src/some-file.ts

🛑 STOP: Please commit all changes before creating a release.

A release should be a clean snapshot of committed work.

Please commit your changes first:
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"

Then run /push-release again.
```

**Exit if working directory is dirty. Do not proceed.**

---

**If working directory is clean:**

```
✅ Working directory is clean. Proceeding with release...
```

Continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Determine Current Version

Get the latest version tag:

```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -n 1
```

**Parse the version:**
- If no tags exist: Current version is `v0.0.0`
- If tags exist: Extract version number (e.g., `v2.0.0` → major=2, minor=0, patch=0)

**Show current version:**
```
📍 Current Version: v2.0.0
```

---

## Step 3: Ask User for Release Type

**Question**: "What type of release is this?"

**Header**: "Release Type"

**Options**:

1. **Major Release (vX.0.0)**
   - Breaking changes
   - Major new features
   - Significant architecture changes
   - Example: v2.0.0 → v3.0.0

2. **Minor Release (v2.X.0)**
   - New features (backwards compatible)
   - Enhancements to existing features
   - New commands or skills
   - Example: v2.0.0 → v2.1.0

3. **Patch Release (v2.0.X)**
   - Bug fixes
   - Documentation updates
   - Minor improvements
   - Example: v2.0.0 → v2.0.1

**multiSelect**: false

---

## Step 4: Calculate New Version

Based on user selection:

**Major Release:**
- Increment major version
- Reset minor and patch to 0
- Example: v2.3.5 → v3.0.0

**Minor Release:**
- Keep major version
- Increment minor version
- Reset patch to 0
- Example: v2.3.5 → v2.4.0

**Patch Release:**
- Keep major and minor versions
- Increment patch version
- Example: v2.3.5 → v2.3.6

**Display new version:**
```
🚀 New Version: v2.1.0
```

---

## Step 5: Collect Commits Since Last Release

Get all commits since the last release tag:

```bash
git log v2.0.0..HEAD --oneline --no-merges
```

**If no commits since last release:**
```
⚠️  No commits since last release v2.0.0

Cannot create a new release without changes.

Please make some commits first, then run /push-release again.
```

**Exit if no commits.**

---

**If commits exist:**

```
📝 Commits since v2.0.0:

232f30d Improve /advise and /retrospective efficiency with progressive disclosure
0e82ea7 Enhance retrospective command with git status check and skill updates
2100324 Update retrospective command to ask user for workflow preference
```

Continue to Step 6.

---

## Step 6: Analyze Changes and Generate Changelog

**Analyze commits to extract:**

1. **Major Features** - What big things were added?
2. **Improvements** - What was enhanced?
3. **Bug Fixes** - What was fixed?
4. **Breaking Changes** - What requires user action?
5. **Files Changed** - What files were added, modified, deleted, renamed?

**Read relevant files to understand context:**
- Check README.md for feature descriptions
- Check modified command files for new functionality
- Check skill files for new capabilities

**Generate structured changelog following this format:**

```markdown
## [Emoji] [Release Title]
