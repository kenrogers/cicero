## Cablecast Timestamp Research

- Cablecast documentation doesn't show direct URL timestamp parameters
- Will test with actual video URLs in Phase 3
- Fallback: Display timestamp as text (e.g., "1:23:45") for manual seeking

## Blockers

None - ready to proceed

## Next Actions

1. Create Phase 1 plan
2. Design enhanced schema
3. Research council member roster
