## Summary

Traditional SEO focuses on search engine rankings. LLM SEO (LLMO) ensures your content appears in AI-generated responses from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other AI assistants. This guide covers the technical and content strategies for AI visibility.

## The Rise of AI Crawlers

AI companies now crawl the web at massive scale:

- **GPTBot (OpenAI)**: 569 million monthly requests
- **ClaudeBot (Anthropic)**: 370 million monthly requests
- **PerplexityBot**: 24.4 million monthly requests

Combined, these represent approximately 28% of Googlebot's traffic—and growing rapidly.

## Critical Difference: No JavaScript Execution

Unlike Googlebot, most AI crawlers **do not execute JavaScript**. They only see:

- Server-rendered HTML
- Static content
- JSON in initial response

They cannot see:

- Client-side rendered content
- Dynamically loaded data
- Single-page app (SPA) content

### What This Means for Your Site

If your content is rendered via JavaScript on the client, AI crawlers won't see it. You must use:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**

This starter kit uses Next.js App Router with SSG for blog content, ensuring full visibility to AI crawlers.

## The llms.txt Standard

The `llms.txt` file is an emerging standard that helps AI systems understand your site. Think of it as a curated map for LLMs.

### Format

Located at `/llms.txt`, it uses Markdown:

```markdown
# Your Site Name

> Brief description of your site and its purpose.

## Documentation
- [Getting Started](/docs/start): Quick start guide
- [API Reference](/docs/api): Complete API documentation

## Blog
- [Latest Articles](/blog): All blog posts

## Optional
- [Internal Tools](/tools): Less important pages
```

### How It Differs from robots.txt

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| robots.txt | Tells crawlers where NOT to go |
| sitemap.xml | Lists all available URLs |
| llms.txt | Guides LLMs to important content |

## Technical Optimizations

### 1. Server-Side Rendering

All important content should be in the initial HTML response:

```typescript
// Next.js App Router - Server Component (default)
export default async function BlogPost({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  return <article>{post.content}</article>
}
```

### 2. Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Add schema markup to help LLMs understand context:

```typescript
const jsonLd = {
  '@context': 'https://schema.org',
  '@type': 'TechArticle',
  headline: post.title,
  description: post.description,
  author: { '@type': 'Person', name: post.author },
  datePublished: post.date,
}
```

### 3. Clear Heading Hierarchy

Use semantic HTML with proper heading structure:

- One H1 per page (the title)
- H2 for major sections
- H3 for subsections
- Clear, descriptive headings

### 4. Summary Sections

LLMs extract summaries first. Add a clear summary at the top of each article:

```markdown
## Summary

[2-3 sentence clear summary of the article's key points]
```

## Content Strategies

### Write for Understanding, Not Keywords

LLMs interpret meaning, not keyword density. Focus on:

- Clear, concise explanations
- Consistent terminology
- Logical structure
- Practical examples

### Build Topic Authority

Create comprehensive content clusters:

1. **Pillar content**: In-depth guides on core topics
2. **Supporting articles**: Specific aspects of the topic
3. **Internal linking**: Connect related content

### Include Original Insights

LLMs prioritize unique content:

- Original research and data
- Expert opinions and analysis
- Case studies and examples
- Code samples and implementations

## Bing Indexing is Critical

ChatGPT uses Bing's index for real-time information. If you're not indexed in Bing, you won't appear in ChatGPT responses.

1. Submit your site to Bing Webmaster Tools
2. Submit your sitemap
3. Monitor indexing status

## Key Takeaways

1. **Server-render all important content** - AI crawlers don't execute JavaScript
2. **Implement llms.txt** - Guide AI crawlers to your best content
3. **Use structured data** - Help LLMs understand context
4. **Write clear summaries** - LLMs extract these first
5. **Get indexed in Bing** - Critical for ChatGPT visibility
6. **Focus on depth over keywords** - LLMs interpret meaning

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] All blog content uses SSG/SSR
- [ ] Created `/public/llms.txt`
- [ ] Added JSON-LD structured data
- [ ] Clear heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- [ ] Summary section in each article
- [ ] Submitted to Bing Webmaster Tools
- [ ] robots.txt allows AI crawlers
